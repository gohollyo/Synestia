    "Apollo missions increased our knowledge and understanding of the Moon (insert diagram of rocks). Basalt and glassy soils (volcanism), old surface littered with meteorite impacts (breccias), and highlands (flotation crust that forms from a magma ocean [think of it as a liquified, molten crust that has since cooled]). So the Moon must have been liquified at some point, makes sens\n",
