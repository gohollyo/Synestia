    "To understand the dynamics of a synestia, we must first understand its mechanics (balance of forces). There are three forces at work: the centripetal force (arises from circular motion), the pressure force from the gas, and gravity of components of the structure. A parcel of gas in a synestia is stably orbiting when it follows the following equation:\n",
    "$$\\omega^2r = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{dP}{dr} + \\frac{GM}{r^2}(1 - \\frac{3J_2a_{eq}^2}{2r^2}(\\frac{3z^2}{r^2} - 1))$$\n",
    "where $\\omega$ is the angular velocity of the parcel, r=(x,y,z) is the distance from the parcel to the center of the synestia (origin), $\\rho$ is the density of the parcel of gas, dP/dr is the radial pressure gradient at the location of the parcel, G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the synestia the parcel is orbiting in, J$_2$ is the oblateness of that synestia, a$_{eq}$ is the equatorial radius of this synestia, and z is the vertical distance off the midplane of the parcel of gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "The angular velocity of a parcel of gas in equilibrium (gravitational force, pressure force, and circular motion are balanced so that the particle maintains a stable orbit) will change according to the strength of the gravitational field and the pressure gradient surrounding it in a synestia. The gas density, gas pressure, and second-order gravity are significant forces in shaping the oblate, flared gas structure of a synestia and motion of moonlets inside a synestia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gravity\n",
    "\n",
    "The more massive a synestia is, the larger the equatorial radius of the planet-like region of a synestia is, and the more oblate a synestia is, then the stronger the gravitational field is in that synestia. The stronger the gravitational field, the higher angular velocity the gas particle inside that synestia must have in order to maintain its stable orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The local strength of the gravity field of a synestia will vary based on a gas parcel's location in a synestia. The strongest gravitational forces will be along the midplane and closest to the center of a synestia. Both are considered equilibrium points (where a particle will settle when forces are balanced). As a gas parcel's distance from the rotation axis and midplane increase, the magnitude of gravity will decrease. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pressure Force\n",
    "\n",
    "Density of the gas will also vary based on the parcel's location in a synestia. There is a radial dependency for density. Density decreases off the midplane to higher z, and also decreases at larger distances from a synestia's rotational axis, cylindrical radius r$_{xy}$. Density follows a negative power law dependence in r$_{xy}$ and an exponential decay dependence in z. Density will typically follow the form:\n",
    "$$\\rho = \\rho(r_{xy}, z) = \\rho_0r_{xy}^{-a}e^{-z^2/z_s^2}$$\n",
    "where $\\rho_0$ is a reference density in the midplane, r$_{xy}$ is the cylindrical radius of the gas parcel and makes the base of the power law fit for the midplane, a is the exponent of the midplane's power law fit, z is the vertical position of the parcel of gas, and z$_s$ is the scale height. The scale height is a measure of how quickly the density decreases in z. It measures the e-folding time, or at what z the density reaches 1/e th of its midplane value. The scale height has a power law dependency on cylindrical radius $r_{xy}$ with the form:\n",
    "$$z_s = br_{xy}^c$$\n",
    "where b is a coefficent and c is the exponent of the power law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, gas density and pressure exponentially decay from the midplane to the photosphere (cloud layer) of a synestia, and will do so more quickly at larger distances from a synestia's rotational axis. In the midplane, gas density and pressure decrease with increasing cylindrical radius according to some power law. This shapes a synestia's pressure and density fields into nested, flared contours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greater the density of the gas field and the pressure differential across the gas parcel [one side of the gas particle (smaller radius) has a much stronger pressure than the other side (larger radius)], the larger the pressure support will be for an orbiting gas particle. With increased pressure support, a gas parcel can orbit stably at lower angular velocities. We call these sub-Keplerian orbits. "

    "Similar to a Keplerian orbit, changing the size of the satellite (moon) does not affect the trajectory of its gravitationally balanced orbit. The second-order gravity term affects the orbit of the moon only near certain locations (e.g. at smaller radii nearest the midplane).\n",
    "\n",
    "The moon's orbit significantly deviates from Keplerian in orbits with a smaller semi-major axis. As the semi-major axis of the moon's orbit grows (and the moon moves farther away from the central body), the J$_2$ term is not as strong. Since the oblate gravity affects the orbit less at larger radii, the moon orbits much closer to the corresponding Keplerian orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the inclination of the moon's orbit increases, the moon's orbit rotates, so that the farthest distance from the central body in the orbit changes (x, y) position with time. As the moon passes through the midplane on an inclined orbit, the increase in the J$_2$ gravity term nudges the moonlet outward (a small increase in distance from the central body, r$_{xy}$). This helps turn the moon's orbit about the central body's rotational axis. Inclination affects the moon's orbit in another way. When the moon's orbit moves in the z-direction, along the rotational axis (r$_{xy}$ = 0), the moon will orbit closer to the central body. In the midplane (z = 0), the moon orbits farther away, due to an increase in the J$_2$ gravity term as the moon passes the most oblate portion of the central body (along its equator, in the midplane).\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the eccentricity of the moon's orbit will also rotate the orbit about the central body's rotational axis. As the moon moves through the region where J$_2$ gravity is significant and back out into a region where it is not, the moon will overshoot its orbit a bit and this moves the orbit over. Over time, this allows the orbit to rotate within the midplane. The overshoot can be significant as the orbit's eccentricity increases. If the eccentricity of the moon's orbit is too high, the moon will escape the gravity of the central body and fly off the plot. An eccentric orbit sends the moon into a region of a synestia where oblate gravity is essentially negligible then back again into a region where oblate gravity has a significant effect on the moon's trajectory. This means that the magnitude of gravitational force acting upon the moon changes greatly throughout its orbit, which can destabilize the orbit to a varying degree, based on the eccentricity of the orbit. The larger the eccentricity, the larger the variation, and the more likely destabilization will happen (quickly)."

Hydrostatic equilibrium in z follows this equation:\n",
    "$$\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g_z = -\\rho(r_{xy}, z)\\frac{GMz}{r^3}(1 - \\frac{3J_2a_{eq}^2}{r^2}(\\frac{2.5z^2}{r^2} - 1.5))$$\n",
    "where g$_z$ is the z component of the gravitational acceleration acting at a particular location r = (x, y, z) in a synestia with equatorial radius a$_{eq}$, total mass M, and J$_2$ factor based on its mass distribution (oblateness).\n",
    "\n",
    "The magnitude of the pressure gradient in z of the gas in a synestia will change according to the magnitude of the gas density and gravitational acceleration in z at a particular r$_{xy}$ = (x, y), z location. The pressure gradient term in the balance of forces in a synestia is responsible for the puffiness of a synestia. It causes a synestia to flare and take on a disk-like shape. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look below at the pressure field of an example Moon-forming synestia. If a synestia is in hydrostatic equilibrium, it should look like a flared disk and have the same contours as would be expected for hydrostatic equilibrium."
