    "Research on synestias arose from research on the origin of the Moon. But why has there been recent research on this topic? Since the 1970's, planetary scientists have confirmed and then since agreed that a giant impact to Earth formed the Moon. The birth of the Earth-Moon system via giant impact has not been the point of debate. However, the details of the most-oft proposed giant impact (Mars-size body grazes an early Earth) have been skepticized."

    "List reasons why canonical model doesn't work (number: Earth and Moon eerily similar (almost indistinguishable) to each other in terms of bulk element composition and isotopic composition, something that we do not see amongst the other rocky bodies in our solar system; problematic because it would be highly coincidental for two nearly same composition bodies to collide into one another, given no other two bodies are the same. We know Moon formed from a giant impact between a younger, smaller Earth (the proto-Earth) and an impactor. Assuming the impacting bodies had different compositions, the impact has to mix the material well enough to homogenize it (help make the post-impact material have a consistent compostion throughout, a good blend of the two bodies' materials)). Mars size body slowly hits Earth at glancing angle. Doesn't mix material enough. limited by angular momentum (present-day). Side note: there are ways to decrease angular momentum of Earth-Moon system over time (resonance interactions with the sun). Increase angular momentum, not only are there a greater range of giant impacts that can form the Moon, it also increases the energy available to melt and vaporize the bodies, which can better mix.\n",

    "There are many different kinds of impacts that can create a Moon-forming synestia, anywhere from a medium-sized body slowly grazing a large body (canonical model setup) to two equal size (half-Earth mass) bodies quickly impacting each other (at almost the escape velocity) to a small body ramming into a large body. There are a great multitude of angles, relative velocities, and relative sizes the impactors may hit each other with and still form a Moon. This is what makes a synestia a robust hypothesis for forming the Moon; it is not unique to any one giant impact event."
