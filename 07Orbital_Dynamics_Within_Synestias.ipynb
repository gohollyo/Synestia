    "Synestias are massive, quickly-rotating bodies with liquid and vapor that extends far from the center of its body. They have high angular momentum (compare this to something). Earth-mass synestias have more angular momentum than the present Earth-Moon system. The high angular momentum in a synestia allows a couple of interesting consequences. The moonlets growing in a synestia move based on exchange of angular momentum with the gas surrounding them. The corotating region of a synestia will spin faster if it accretes more mass from decaying moonlets. Why does this happen? There is one physical law of nature that synestias cannot violate: conservation of angular momentum."

Angular momentum is a measure of the resistance of the rotational motion of a body to outside forces. The more massive a body is, the faster the body is moving, and the larger distance from the rotational axis a body is, the more angular momentum the body has. The more angular momentum a body has, the harder it will be to change its angular momentum significantly [e.g. the applied torque (rotational force) to change the body's angular momentum must be greater].

    "Before a giant impact occurs, the two impacting bodies do not typically approach each other head on. Most of the time, the impacting bodies will hit each other at an angle. These two bodies are known as the target and the impactor. The target is the impacting body that would be stationary if the motion's frame of reference were placed on it. The target body does not move relative to the impactor in that frame of reference. Giant impact researchers use a frame of reference because it makes the physics easier, but they know that in reality, both bodies are both moving. In the frame of reference, it looks like the impactor's motion is linear. Without the frame of reference, it is clear that the impacting bodies both move toward each other due to gravitational attraction and swirl in towards each other. This begins the rotational motion of the system generated from the giant impact."

In response, the giant impact generates an angular momentum arm, seen in figure above (Canup, 2012), which manipulates the matter of the post-giant-impact system into a swirling disk-like feature. The angular momentum that results from a moon-forming giant impact can be predicted based on the intial mass of the impacting bodies (Canup, 2012). The larger the mass of the system, the greater angular momentum the resulting post-giant-impact system will have."

As gas drags on the droplet, the droplet spirals in towards the center of a synestia, losing velocity and distance from the rotational axis. The droplet transfers its angular momentum to the gas around it. The velocity of the gas increases in response. Since the droplet will always move faster than the gas, the increase in velocity will mean a smaller velocity differential between the gas and a droplet at the gas particle's location. It's too late for this to affect the first droplet that spiralled in, but if there were another droplet traveling behind the first droplet, the gas drag on the droplet would be weaker."

The Earth-Moon system, freshly formed from a synestia with higher angular momentum than the present-day Earth-Moon system, can decrease its Earth-Moon system angular momentum by transferring it to its sun when the three body system is aligned just right (this is known as an <i>evection resonance</i>; Cuk and Stewart, 2012).
