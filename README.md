# Synestias
The Jupyter Notebook Synestias.ipynb defines synestias and helps build intuition for the physical structure and internal dynamics of a synestia.
The Jupyter Notebook MoonFormationinaSynestia.ipynb explores how moons growing inside synestias are affected by the gas and other moons around them.


More questions about synestias? There are a couple of articles written by Dr. Simon Lock and Dr. Sarah T. Stewart ([Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-earth-and-the-moon-were-one/), [2017 research paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016JE005239) in JGR Planets) that you may read or you can check out Dr. Stewart's TED talk below.
