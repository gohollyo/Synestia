    "This is a plot of the midplane (z = 0) angular velocity profile. The profile is continuous because there are no dynamically distinct features of a synestia. It is a connected body. Notice that the profile is flat at smaller radii. This is the corotating portion of a synestia. All material rotates about its axis together at the same (rapid) angular velocity. At larger radii, the profile drops off, where material in a synestia can no longer corotate.\n",

    "The angular velocity is lower than what it would be for a Keplerian orbit. A Keplerian orbit is a stable (no inward or outward spiralling) elliptical orbit. The orbiting body is moving fast enough through a vacuum around its central body to resist the inward pull of the central body's first-order gravity. In other words, the only force that is acting (and is balanced) is gravity. In the non-corotating region of a synestia, the material experiences a sub-Keplerian orbit. There is sufficient pressure support to counteract gravity. This allows the gas to orbit at an angular velocity that is slower than it would be for an equivalent Keplerian orbit."
