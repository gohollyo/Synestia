    "# Keplerian Orbit\n",
    "A Keplerian orbit is an orbit balanced by first order gravity only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following equation describes the motion of a body in orbit around a central body where gravity is the only force involved. This equation will hold true for any orbiting mass subject only to first-order gravitational forces. A Keplerian orbit is dependent on the mass of the central body (the body being orbited e.g. the corotating region of a synestia) and how much distance there is between the orbiting body and the orbited body.\n",
    "\n",
    "A circular orbit is a Keplerian orbit with zero eccentricity. This means the path traced by the orbiting body is a circle. If the eccentricity of a Keplerian orbit is greater than zero, the orbital path becomes an ellipse and no longer follows a circular orbit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is what a circular Keplerian orbit should look like for a moonlet orbiting within the dimensions of a typical Moon-forming synestia."
