The speed of Earth's trajectory around the Sun would be faster if Earth were closer to the Sun and maintained its angular velocity. The farther body 1 is from body 2, the faster body 1's linear velocity will be to complete an orbit in the same amount of time (in order to maintain its angular velocity)."

    "For example, a figure skater spins with a certain angular velocity. Since each part of their body is connected [think of your body as a connected collection of very small volumes (e.g. cells, body parts)], every component rotates together at the same angular velocity. Each component has the same angular velocity, but may be moving at a different speed than other components in order to remain part of the body.\n",

    "Say a spinning figure skater's arm is extended. The hand has a larger radius and has to travel a longer arc about the body to line up with the shoulder, which is closer to the rotational axis (smaller radius) and does not have to travel as large of a distance about the body. In the same amount of time, these body parts must travel different speeds to maintain the body's rate of rotation (angular velocity). A component must move faster if it is located at larger radii from the rotational axis.\n",
